Title: Streamlit Chatbot - Explore and Engage

Description:

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with a chatbot. The chatbot leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to understand your questions and provide informative responses.

Key Features:

    Intuitive Interface: The Streamlit app offers a simple and interactive chat window for seamless communication with the chatbot.
    Powerful LLM Integration: The chatbot leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand your queries and generate relevant responses.
    Customizable Experience: (Optional) You can customize the chatbot's behavior by adjusting parameters like the LLM model or response style.
    (Optional) Integration with Specific Data Sources: The chatbot can be enhanced to access and process data from specific sources, such as a trained PDF model (mentioned in the previous discussion). This allows it to provide even more contextually relevant information.
